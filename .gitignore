# You should almost always have a .gitignore file in your repo. There are lots of files that will commonly be in your
# project that you wouldn't want included in the repository for various reasons. I've included some common filetypes
# below that tend to show up in React projects and should NOT be included

# Node packages take up TONS of space and can just be downloaded/installed by other users with `npm i`
# You had already included this, but I've provided the same file for both you and Brian.
node_modules

# Mac computers sometimes add this hidden file
.DS_STORE

# Some editors (including IntelliJ Idea and VSCode) will include settings files in your repo.
.idea
.vscode

# Sometimes you'll have files that contain sensitive information or toggle environment variables that shouldn't be included
.env
.secrets

# Build/compiled files/directories are also unnecessary, as they can be rebuilt
target
build

# Compiled source #

# git has its own built in compression methods

# Logs and databases #
*.log
